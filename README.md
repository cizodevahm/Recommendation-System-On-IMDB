# Recommendation-System-On-IMDB
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the creation of a content-based movie recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.

# Overview
This project is based on Emma Grimaldi’s tutorial on building a content-based movie recommender system. The system suggests movies based on user interests by analyzing movie descriptions and finding similar content.

# Features
### Content-Based Filtering: 
Recommends movies similar to those the user likes.
### NLP Techniques: 
Utilizes Python’s NLP libraries to process and analyze movie descriptions.
### Interactive Jupyter Notebook:
Provides a step-by-step guide and code implementation.
